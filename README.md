# Defined format for RADx data file metadata

This repository includes the definition file for the RADx Data File Metadata Specification, the spreadsheet that generated it, and the other component artifacts that make up the metadata specification. 

The documentation for this metadata file can be found online in the [RADx Metadata Specification Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191Hy6jzM762X_KPrC6lk3kQalargCBJ5r_KiBoCw5i0). Users are requested to refer to that document for the latest information on how to use this specification.

The license is provisionally specified as a BSD 3-clause license, just to represent the information in this document as being freely reusable. There are likely to be other license considerations that make it even more reusableâ€”we'll work on clarifying the reality.
