# Defined format for RADx data file metadata

This repository includes the definition file for the RADx Data File Metadata Specification, the spreadsheet that generated it, and the other component artifacts that make up the metadata specification. 

The documentation for this metadata specification can be found online in the [RADx Metadata Specification Manual](https://rad.github.io/radx-metadata-specification-docs). Users are requested to refer to that document for the latest information on how to use this specification.

The original copy of the metadata specification is maintained in the CEDAR system in [this folder](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org/dashboard?folderId=https:%2F%2Frepo.metadatacenter.org%2Ffolders%2Fbb251c56-a720-4b39-92ea-55c053f1ad00). If you do not have a CEDAR account, you may view [an OpenView copy of the specification](https://openview.metadatacenter.org/templates/https:%2F%2Frepo.metadatacenter.org%2Ftemplates%2Fec918d9b-fcd2-4e6e-b63b-2c67aece9f68). 

You may also view [an example set of metadata using this template](https://openview.metadatacenter.org/template-instances/https:%2F%2Frepo.metadatacenter.org%2Ftemplate-instances%2F10e80027-a196-43a8-bc57-dd909918ae09). (This is using a slightly older version of the template but has almost exactly the same fields; the example will be replaced with an update version soon.)

The original specification work was performed using Google sheets. You can see it in [this tab in Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kwe4PFodciXo-XDX2bHN8F-CRAmopguoI9YKFX6piaQ/edit#gid=802588906). Look on the first tab of that workbook for additional context.

The license is provisionally specified as a BSD 3-clause license, just to represent the information in this document as being freely reusable. There are likely to be other license considerations that make it even more reusableâ€”we'll work on clarifying the reality.
